## Literature Review




## Dataset Identification
Datset 1: National Centers for Environmental Information - Storm Events Database (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/stormevents/)
This dataset provides an Excel CSV file for different storm events in Oregon, such as droughts and tornadoes. For this project, we will use the "Heat" event type data (instances of heat above 100 degrees) and select only counties in Oregon. Each instance of the data was collected by a different source (listed on the spreadsheet), such as Official NWS Observations, Trained spotters, and county officials. The data includes values for start date, end date, geographic zone, specific temperatures, deaths, and injuries. We will have to manually add a county column extracted from the zone column, in order to join it with our OBA data. I also wanted to add cold events but there is not much data there.
