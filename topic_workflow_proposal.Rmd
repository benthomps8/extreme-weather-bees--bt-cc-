## Literature Review

Extreme weather events are rapidly emerging as one of the biggest climate-driven ecological stressors worldwide (IPCC 2021). Heat waves, cold snaps, ice storms, atmospheric rivers, and other short-duration extremes are increasing in frequency and severity, and these events can trigger massive ecological impacts in a matter of hours or days (Bilton et al. 2019; Thornton et al. 2023). Oregon is already experiencing rapid swings in temperature and winter storm intensity, with climate projections suggesting that extreme weather will become increasingly more common in the future (Oregon Climate Change Research Institute 2023). Insects, especially bees, are extremely sensitive to quick shifts in temperature because their flight performance, metabolism, and foraging ability are directly affected by thermal limits (Heinrich 1979; Woods et al. 2019). While there is a huge amount of research showing that pollinator declines are linked to habitat loss and gradual warming trends across landscapes (Potts et al. 2016), less work has focused on what short-term extreme events do to wild bee populations. Because bees support plant reproduction and agricultural production throughout Oregon, understanding how heat waves, cold snaps, and other extreme weather events affect bee diversity is critical for conservation, ecosystem functioning, and resilience in the face of accelerating climate instability.
Previous research has shown that extreme heat can cause lethal overheating and reduce bee survival by shutting down normal thermoregulation (Pereboom & Biesmeijer 2003; Woods et al. 2019). Other work has shown that sudden freezing temperatures can rapidly kill overwintering bees or prevent them from emerging from nests (Franzén & Öckinger 2012). Research on severe winter storms has found population crashes in bees following ice-heavy winters because ice can cover flowers, prevent foraging, and physically damage habitat structure (Riley et al. 2018). In addition, research shows that bees are already declining due to multiple compounding stressors, including habitat loss and resource limitation (Goulson et al. 2015), which suggests that extreme weather events may add yet another layer of pressure to bee populations. Overall, the literature supports that extreme weather events can directly reduce bee survival, disrupt daily behavior, and shift community composition over time.
To address this question in Oregon, we will use two main datasets. First, the Oregon Bee Atlas dataset provides species-level records and sampling data across many Oregon counties. Second, the NOAA Storm Events Database provides time and location records of extreme heat events, extreme cold events, and ice storms. Because the NOAA data is categorized by county or zone and not by habitat type, our analyses will focus on Oregon-wide patterns rather than trying to isolate “urban” vs “rural” differences. By aligning bee sampling dates with storm event windows, we can evaluate whether changes in bee diversity occur immediately after extreme weather events such as extreme heat, extreme cold, or ice storm events.
The purpose of our study is to measure how specific extreme weather events influence bee observations across Oregon. We will compare bee data from before and after such weather events, and test whether there are consistent patterns in diversity and species composition. This analysis will help fill an information gap, because most research to date has focused on gradual warming trends or individual mechanisms, rather than real-world event-driven impacts across a regional scale. Our main hypothesis is: We predict that extreme heat, extreme cold, and ice storm events will reduce bee diversity across Oregon following the weather events. If supported, these results will help guide conservation planning under future climate scenarios by identifying which types of extreme weather events are most impactful for bees. This could help natural resource managers target conservation efforts such as planting strategies, habitat protection, or nest site support in areas most at risk as climate extremes increase.

## Dataset Identification
Dataset 1: National Centers for Environmental Information - Storm Events Database (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/stormevents/)
This dataset provides an Excel CSV file for different storm events in Oregon, such as droughts and tornadoes. For this specific dataset, we are using only the "extreme heat" event ID (instances of heat above 100 degrees) and selecting only counties in Oregon. Each instance of the data was collected by a different source (listed on the spreadsheet), such as Official NWS Observations, Trained spotters, and county officials. The data includes values for start date, end date, geographic zone, specific temperatures, deaths, and injuries. We will have to manually add a county column extracted from the zone column, in order to join it with our OBA data. 

Dataset 2: National Centers for Environmental Information - Storm Events Database (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/stormevents/)
Added additional dataset from the same source. This time, I queried for winter weather, winter storm, ice storm, frost/freeze, extreme cold/wind chill, and cold/wind chill. Metadata is the same as dataset 1 for extreme heat. This dataset only has one date, no start and end. This is okay, as we will likely only look at the end date for the heat data anyways. Dataset was collected by multiple sources (trained spotters, county officials, etc...) and compiled by NOAA. 

Data for both of the datasets contains the following columns:
EVENT_ID: An identification number used by NOAA
CZ_NAME_STR: The location of where the event occurred. Typically a zone or region, such as central Oregon or southern coast. This is the column we used for extracting the county.
BEGIN_DATE: String representing the start date in format DD/MM/YYYY
BEGIN_TIME: Integer data representing time of day, with values from 0 to 2400
EVENT_TYPE: Event type we queried for, includes "Heat", "Extreme cold/wind chill", etc...
MAGNITUDE: Blank column (used for earthquakes, if we had queried for that)
TOR_F_SCALE: Also blank column
DEATHS_DIRECT: Integer data. 0 is used for no deaths
INJURIES_DIRECT: Integer data. 0 is used for no injuries
DAMAGE_PROPERTY_NUM: Integer data. Estimated number of property damage in USD
DAMAGE_CROPS_NUM: Integer data. Estimated amount of crop damage in USD.
STATE_ABBR: String with state abbreviation (all datas are "OR" since that's what we queried for)
CZ_TIMEZONE: All are "PST-8"
MAGNITUDE_TYPE: Blank column, used for other disaster types
EPISODE_ID: Unique ID used by NOAA
CZ_TYPE: Location (C for county, z for forecast zone)
CZ_FIPS: FIPS code for specific location
WFO: Weather Forecast Office in charge of that location
INJURIES_INDIRECT: Amount of indirect injuries recorded
DEATHS_INDIRECT: Amount of indirect deaths recorded
SOURCE: How that data was collected (public, department of highways, etc...)




## Workflow Plan (review)
Before we join our datasets together, we will have to clean the data. For the OBA dataset, we will want to only keep the columns for specimen, genus, date, county, locality, the coordinate columns, species sex, and the plant genus as well. We don't really have a need to keep the ID columns for example. We will also need to create a new date column that follows the same conventions as the one in the extreme weather dataset. This means using excel functions to figure out if a date in the OBA dataset falls within the begin/end date on the extreme heat dataset. For our extreme heat dataset (Dataset 1), we will want to only keep the relevant columns. This means Removing the columns for zone, event type (All of them are the same since we filtered on the website), deaths, injuries, damage, state, timezone, event ID, and the other identification columns. We pretty much need to just keep the start date, end date, county, and description columns (in case we need to examine specific temperatures). 

Once we clean the data, we can join the OBA data table and the first extreme weather dataset on the County and date columns, since they follow the same naming conventions for each table. It will be an outer join. We will have some null values in the instances of the bees and plants that didn't fall within one of the heatwaves. We will want to compare our data collected outside of the extreme weather, with the data in the extreme weather, to see if the temperature impacted pollination or bee appearances or anything else. 

After joining the data, we will want to figure out a null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis. In this project, these are as follows:

Null: Extreme weather events have no impact on bee's pollination
Alternative: Extreme weather and temperature causes bees to pollinate fewer flowers

Then, we will prepare for AB testing by then shuffling the data, without replacement, on the weather event column. This will randomly assign values of event (ex/, heatwaves or not heatwaves) to the bees. We can then simulate this x number of times, probably 1000 or 10000, to simulate a totally random population null model. We then calculate the p value with math and determine whether or not to reject our null. 

The psuedocode for this process will look something like this:

clean(OBA_data), remove_na(OBA_data), clean(weather_data), join(OBA_data, weather_data, by=County), for (i in 1:10000) {results.append(shuffle(with_replacement=FALSE, by=weather_event))}, plot(results), calculate_p_value(results, observed_statistic)
